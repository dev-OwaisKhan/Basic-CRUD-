Basic CRUD Android App 
===========================
The App is done in JAVA and by implementing SQLiteOpenHelper Class
---------------------------------

🧠Intention behind building this app is solely to learn basic manipulation of data using SQLiteOpenHelper
which is as follows :-
* To *add/create* new data to the DataBase.
* To *retrieve* the data from the DataBase.
* To *update* the stored data in the DataBase.
* To *delete* the stored data in the DataBase.

### 🗒️ Note :- 
<p align="left"> As mention above App is Just to understand the concept i.e. how things work. Therefore the UI and Design is very basic and not very compatible. And have some 
Issue with could lead to the fail of app. But again is just basic concept. And I'm planning to used this Basic Crud as the foundation to build an app which will be 
used to perform all the function as a Contacts app.
